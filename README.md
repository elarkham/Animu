Animu
=====

Video managment JSON API that serves as the backend for [`Animu-Web`](https://github.com/elarkham/Animu-Web). This app serves as a “Hello World” for introducing myself to new technologies and as such is never made with the intention of use in a production system. This is the third iteration using the Elixir + Phoenix Framework as the backend.

Setup
=====

 * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
 * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
 * Populate the database with `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
 * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
